Program is run with one command line argument in the name of a file to read from.
The file read into the program from the command line should have in its first entry the number of numbers in the file
after that the program will sort the numbers using the four sorting methods of Merge, Insertion, Selection, and Bubble sorts and output the results to a file called srobbinsResults.txt
In addition to this output there will be additional output sent to the command line about the time that each algorithm took to run on the same data.

To compile simply type make into the command line. An executable named main.out will be generated which will be used to run the program.
